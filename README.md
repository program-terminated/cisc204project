# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Minesweeper Logic Model Project

Our logical model of minesweeper is made to analyze a minesweeper scenario given the board in order to determine which posistions are bombs or safe for 1 step. We have organized our github to contain a draft and final copy in the documents. We will utuilze run.py and test.py in order to test our board and create a working logical model. As of October 28, this is what files we are utilizing:

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
